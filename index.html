    <br>
    <p> A student of today is the visionary and torch-bearer of tomorrow. Nevertheless, a constant inspiration and a
      dynamic motivation are the essential pre-requisites of the gentle opening of a student’s mind. Our vision and
      objective are directed to that. Together with high educational standard, we inculcate a strong sense of discipline
      and social responsibility in the minds of the students so that in future they become responsible citizens endowed
      with right kind of leadership qualities in every sphere of life.</p>

      <h2>Founder Of Ram Mohan Mission And</h2>
      <h2>Ram Mohan Mission High School</h2>
      <h2>Rev. Shankar Biswas</h2>
      <h2>(1938 - 2011)</h2>
      <br>
      <img id="pro" src="Founder.png"><br><br>
      <br>
      <p>Sri Sankar Biswas bathed in the visionary lights and blessings of three legendary souls Raja Rammohan Roy,
        Swami
        Vivekananda and Pt. Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and held their ideals, thought mission, vision and deeds in his
        mind
        with highest respect and worked like an idealist, realist and positivist relentlessly throughout his life to
        eradicate fierce social evils & superstitions from the Indian society and brought about social crusade to reform
        Indian society in its root and branch.</p>
      <br>
      <p>He had a very compassionate vision with a mission to serve for the welfare of the masses with health services,
        education, environmental consciousness and raising awareness campaigns against the fierce social evils prevalent
        in
        the Indian society which are continuing till today.<br><br>

    <h2>What's New</h2>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-7">
          <h3>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h3><br>
          <img src="Online-.png" id="k" height="500px" width="500px">
          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            1.Attendance Tracking In Real-Time<br><br>

            A student attendance management system helps to track and store the attendance data in real-time. Besides
            student and staff attendance, the system also helps school admins in maintaining and tracking leaves
            applications, arrival & departure times, lunch breaks, and vacations of staff members & students.
            <br><br>
            2.Automate The Payroll Process<br><br>

            If the Payroll management software is coupled with the attendance management system, then the payroll
            process
            becomes automated and more efficient. The school HR can easily track absences and leaves of staff members at
            one
            glance, and adjust salaries as necessary based on that information.
            Using the system also reduces the chances of errors in the payroll system. Since the biometric system
            calculates
            the exact working hours, holidays, the HR team is less susceptible to make errors in tabulating the payroll.
            <br><br>
            3.Absence of Proxy Attendance<br><br>
            In many schools, especially the higher grades, students manipulate the daily attendance with proxies, buddy
            punching or tampering of records in a matter of concern. Using a biometric/RFID system with an attendance
            module
            makes it virtually impossible to fake attendance, as each individual’s biometric information is unique.
            This ensures that the attendance is accurate with no opportunity for student manipulation. It also improves
            the
            punctuality and the discipline of the students.

          <h3>New School Canteens</h3><br>

          <img src="jjjj.webp" height="500px" width="500px">
          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            As part of the school environment, a canteen is in a unique position to make a positive contribution to
            students’ health and welfare. The functions of school canteens are to:<br><br>

            1.provide a service to the school community<br><br>
            2.provide a variety of nutritious and attractively presented food and drinks at a reasonable cost and
            reinforce
            classroom learning<br><br>
            3.The canteen provides a rewarding opportunity for parents to be involved in their child’s school. A canteen
            can
            become an essential source of nutrition education that supports what students learn in the classroom and
            supports a whole school approach to healthy eating such as; the school produce garden.<br><br><br>
            Advantages of School Canteens
            <br><br>
            1.Convenience is one key advantage of canteens and cafeterias. Students do not need to leave the school for
            their lunches, which allows more time for eating and means that parents do not need to rush to pack a lunch
            in
            the morning.<br><br>
            2.Improving a student's overall nutritional health is another benefit. Schools that participate in the
            National
            School Lunch program are required to provide a complete and balanced lunch for students .
